quality of their docs though

## Contributing

This project is closed to contributions as it is a personal assignment, 
but if you are compelled to point something out, feel free to open an issue or create a pull request. 
I don't guarantee that I will see it promptly though.  

## Testing

Jest framework in use. Testing is directed primarily towards class methods and object centric functions.
Rendering of html functions have had minimal testing as the final output is very much the easiest place to test 
output, automatic testing of rendered text and render modifications is a rabbit hole better avoided and picked up 
with visual testing a few times.
